####      Examples of how to set the viewer_channel         ####
#
# To build a Release or Release candidate in build bingo:
#    bingo.viewer_channel = "Second Life Release"
#
# To build a Beta for the 'Bingo' project in build bingo:
#    bingo.viewer_channel = "Second Life Beta Bingo"
#
# To build a Project viewer for the 'Bingo' project in build bingo:
#    bingo.viewer_channel = "Second Life Project Bingo"
#
# If left unset, viewer_channel defaults to 'Second Life Test',
# which is appropriate for individual developer builds.
#
# All Linden Lab builds (and only Linden Lab builds)
# should use a viewer_channel that begins with "Second Life"
################################################################
viewer_channel = "Second Life Test"

# Special packaging parameters.
# These parameters can be used to create additional packages
# which identify themselves in a distinct way with either
# a sourceid (sent to web services) or a channel name (sent to login)
# the default sourceid should always be a null string:
sourceid = ""
# the additional_packages variable is a blank separated list of package prefixes:
additional_packages = ""
# to set the special values for a package, create variables using each prefix:
#   additional_packages = "Foo Bar"
#   Foo_sourceid = "bingo"
#   Foo_viewer_channel_suffix = "Foo"
#   Bar_sourceid = "bongo"
#   Bar_viewer_channel_suffix = "Bar"
# the viewer_channel_suffix is prefixed by a blank and then appended to the viewer_channel
# for the package in a setting that overrides the compiled-in value
################################################################
additional_packages = "EDU"

# The EDU package allows us to create a separate release channel whose expirations
# are synchronized as much as possible with the academic year
EDU_sourceid = ""
EDU_viewer_channel_suffix = "edu"

# Notifications - to configure email notices use the TeamCity parameter
# setting screen for your project or build configuration to set the
# environment variable 'email' to a space-separated list of email addresses
