/**
 * Derive your TUT callback from chained_callback instead of tut::callback to
 * ensure that multiple such callbacks can coexist in a given test executable.
 * The relevant callback method will be called for each callback instance in
 * reverse order of the instance's link() methods being called: the most
 * recently link()ed callback will be called first, then the previous, and so
 * forth.
 *
 * Obviously, for this to work, all relevant callbacks must be derived from
 * chained_callback instead of tut::callback. Given that, control should reach
 * each of them regardless of their construction order. The chain is
 * guaranteed to stop because the first link() call will link to test_runner's
 * default_callback, which is simply an instance of the callback() base class.
 *
 * The rule for deriving from chained_callback is that you may override any of
 * its virtual methods, but your override must at some point call the
 * corresponding chained_callback method.
