/**
 * In the brave new world of lambdas, we can use a nicer C++ idiom for testing
 * exceptions than CATCH_AND_STORE_WHAT_IN() below, e.g.:
 *
 * @code
 * std::string threw = catch_what<std::runtime_error>(
 *     [](){ throw std::runtime_error("badness"); });
 * ensure_equals(threw, "badness");
 * @endcode
 */

std::string catch_what(FUNC func)
{
    try
    {
        func();
        return {};
    }
    catch (const EXCEPTION& err)
    {
        return err.what();
    }
}

/**
 * Idiom useful for test programs: catch an expected exception, store its
 * what() string in a specified std::string variable. From there the caller
 * can do things like:
 * @code
 * ensure("expected exception not thrown", ! string.empty());
 * @endcode
 * or
 * @code
 * ensure_contains("exception doesn't mention blah", string, "blah");
 * @endcode
 * etc.
 *
 * The trouble is that when linking to a dynamic libllcommon.so on Linux, we
 * generally fail to catch the specific exception. Oddly, we can catch it as
 * std::runtime_error and validate its typeid().name(), so we do -- but that's
 * a lot of boilerplate per test. Encapsulate with this macro. Usage:
 *
 * @code
 * std::string threw;
 * try
 * {
 *     some_call_that_should_throw_Foo();
 * }
 * CATCH_AND_STORE_WHAT_IN(threw, Foo)
 * ensure("some_call_that_should_throw_Foo() didn't throw", ! threw.empty());
 * @endcode
