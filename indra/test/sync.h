 * @brief  Synchronize coroutines within a test program so we can observe side
 *         effects. Certain test programs test coroutine synchronization
 *         mechanisms. Such tests usually want to interleave coroutine
 *         executions in strictly stepwise fashion. This class supports that
 *         paradigm.
