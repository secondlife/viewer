    /*
    Event API

    LLLogin will issue multiple events to it pump to indicate the
    progression of states through login. The most important
    states are "offline" and "online" which indicate auth failure
    and auth success respectively.

    pump: login (tweaked)
    These are the events posted to the 'login'
    event pump from the login module.
    {
        state       :   string, // See below for the list of states.
        progress    :   real // for progress bar.
        data        :   LLSD // Dependent upon state.
    }

    States for method 'login_to_simulator'
    offline - set initially state and upon failure. data is the server response.
    srvrequest - upon uri rewrite request. no data.
    authenticating - upon auth request. data, 'attempt' number and 'request' llsd.
    downloading - upon ack from auth server, before completion. no data
    online - upon auth success. data is server response.


    Dependencies:
    pump: LLAres
    LLLogin makes a request for a SRV record from the uri provided by the connect method.
    The following event pump should exist to service that request.
    pump name: LLAres
    request = {
        op : "rewriteURI"
        uri : string
        reply : string

    pump: LLXMLRPCListener
    The request merely passes the credentials LLSD along, with one additional
    member, 'reply', which is the string name of the event pump to reply on.
