/**
 * Registry of named Boost.Coroutine instances
 *
 * The Boost.Coroutine library supports the general case of a coroutine
 * accepting arbitrary parameters and yielding multiple (sets of) results. For
 * such use cases, it's natural for the invoking code to retain the coroutine
 * instance: the consumer repeatedly calls into the coroutine, perhaps passing
 * new parameter values, prompting it to yield its next result.
 *
 * Our typical coroutine usage is different, though. For us, coroutines
 * provide an alternative to the @c Responder pattern. Our typical coroutine
 * has @c void return, invoked in fire-and-forget mode: the handler for some
 * user gesture launches the coroutine and promptly returns to the main loop.
 * The coroutine initiates some action that will take multiple frames (e.g. a
 * capability request), waits for its result, processes it and silently steals
 * away.
 *
 * This usage poses two (related) problems:
 *
 * # Who should own the coroutine instance? If it's simply local to the
 *   handler code that launches it, return from the handler will destroy the
 *   coroutine object, terminating the coroutine.
 * # Once the coroutine terminates, in whatever way, who's responsible for
 *   cleaning up the coroutine object?
 *
 * LLCoros is a Singleton collection of currently-active coroutine instances.
 * Each has a name. You ask LLCoros to launch a new coroutine with a suggested
 * name prefix; from your prefix it generates a distinct name, registers the
 * new coroutine and returns the actual name.
 *
 * The name
 * can provide diagnostic info: we can look up the name of the
 * currently-running coroutine.

     * VALUE! Reference parameters are a BAD IDEA! You Have Been Warned. See
     * DEV-32777 comments for an explanation.

     * Pass a nullary callable. It works to directly pass a nullary free
     * function (or static method); for other cases use a lambda expression,
     * std::bind() or boost::bind(). Of course, for a non-static class method,
     * the first parameter must be the class instance. Any other parameters
     * should be passed via the enclosing expression.
     *
     * launch() tweaks the suggested name so it won't collide with any
     * existing coroutine instance, creates the coroutine instance, registers
     * it with the tweaked name and runs it until its first wait. At that
     * point it returns the tweaked name.
