/**
 * This class is a growable buffer between a producer and consumer. It serves
 * as a queue usable with Boost.Iostreams -- hence, a "stream queue."
 *
 * This is especially useful for buffering nonblocking I/O. For instance, we
 * want application logic to be able to serialize LLSD to a std::ostream. We
 * may write more data than the destination pipe can handle all at once, but
 * it's imperative NOT to block the application-level serialization call. So
 * we buffer it instead. Successive frames can try nonblocking writes to the
 * destination pipe until all buffered data has been sent.
 *
 * Similarly, we want application logic be able to deserialize LLSD from a
 * std::istream. Again, we must not block that deserialize call waiting for
 * more data to arrive from the input pipe! Instead we build up a buffer over
 * a number of frames, using successive nonblocking reads, until we have
 * "enough" data to be able to present it through a std::istream.
 *
 * @note The use cases for this class overlap somewhat with those for the
 * LLIOPipe/LLPumpIO hierarchies, and indeed we considered using those. This
 * class has two virtues over the older machinery:
 *
 * # It's vastly simpler -- way fewer concepts. It's not clear to me whether
 *   there were ever LLIOPipe/etc. use cases that demanded all the fanciness
 *   rolled in, or whether they were simply overdesigned. In any case, no
 *   remaining Lindens will admit to familiarity with those classes -- and
 *   they're sufficiently obtuse that it would take considerable learning
 *   curve to figure out how to use them properly. The bottom line is that
 *   current management is not keen on any more engineers climbing that curve.
 * # This class is designed around available components such as std::string,
 *   std::list, Boost.Iostreams. There's less proprietary code.
