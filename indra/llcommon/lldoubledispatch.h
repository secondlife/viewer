/**
 * This class supports function calls which are virtual on the dynamic type of
 * more than one parameter. Specifically, we address a limited but useful
 * subset of that problem: function calls which accept two parameters, and
 * select which particular function to call depending on the dynamic type of
 * both.
 *
 * Scott Meyers, in More Effective C++ (Item 31), talks about some of the perils
 * and pitfalls lurking down this pathway.  He discusses and dismisses the
 * straightforward approaches of using single-dispatch virtual functions twice,
 * and of using a family of single-dispatch virtual functions which each examine
 * RTTI for their other parameter.  He advocates using a registry in which you
 * look up the actual types of both parameters (he uses the classes' string names,
 * via typeid(param).name()) to obtain a pointer to a free (non-member) function
 * that will accept this pair of parameters.
 *
 * He does point out that his approach doesn't handle inheritance.  If you have a
 * registry entry for SpaceShip, and you have in hand a MilitaryShip (subclass of
 * SpaceShip) and an Asteroid, you'd like to call the function appropriate for
 * SpaceShips and Asteroids -- but alas, his lookup fails because the class name
 * for your MilitaryShip subclass isn't in the registry.
 *
 * This class extends his idea to build a registry whose entries can examine the
 * dynamic type of the parameter in a more flexible way -- using dynamic_cast<>
 * -- thereby supporting inheritance relationships.
 *
 * Of course we must allow for the ambiguity this permits. We choose to use a
 * sequence container rather than a map, and require that the client code
 * specify the order in which dispatch-table entries should be searched. The
 * result resembles the semantics of the catch clauses for a try/catch block:
 * you must code catch clauses in decreasing order of specificity, because if
 * you catch ErrorBaseClass before you catch ErrorSubclass, then any
 * ErrorSubclass exceptions thrown by the protected code will always match
 * ErrorBaseClass, and you will never reach your catch(ErrorSubclass) clause.
 *
 * So, in a similar way, if you have a specific routine to process
 * MilitaryShip and Asteroid, you'd better place that in the table @em before
 * your more general routine that processes SpaceShip and Asteroid, or else
 * the MilitaryShip variant will never be called.
 *
 * @todo This implementation doesn't attempt to deal with
 * <tt>const</tt>-correctness of arguments. Our container stores templated
 * objects into which the specific parameter types have been "frozen." But to
 * store all these in the same container, they are all instances of a base
 * class with a virtual invocation method. Naturally the base-class virtual
 * method definition cannot know the <tt>const</tt>-ness of the particular
 * types with which its template subclass is instantiated.
 *
 * One is tempted to suggest four different virtual methods, one for each
 * combination of @c const and non-<tt>const</tt> arguments. Then the client
 * will select the particular virtual method that best fits the
 * <tt>const</tt>-ness of the arguments in hand. The trouble with that idea is
 * that in order to instantiate the subclass instance, we must compile all
 * four of its virtual method overrides, which means we must be prepared to
 * pass all four combinations of @c const and non-<tt>const</tt> arguments to
 * the registered callable. That only works when the registered callable
 * accepts both parameters as @c const.
 *
 * Of course the virtual method overrides could use @c const_cast to force
 * them to compile correctly regardless of the <tt>const</tt>-ness of the
 * registered callable's parameter declarations. But if we're going to force
 * the issue with @c const_cast anyway, why bother with the four different
 * virtual methods? Why not just require canonical parameter
 * <tt>const</tt>-ness for any callables used with this mechanism?
 *
 * We therefore require that your callable accept both params as
 * non-<tt>const</tt>. (This is more general than @c const: you can perform @c
 * const operations on a non-<tt>const</tt> parameter, but you can't perform
 * non-<tt>const</tt> operations on a @c const parameter.)
 *
 * For ease of use, though, our invocation method accepts both params as @c
 * const. Again, you can pass a non-<tt>const</tt> object to a @c const param,
 * but not the other way around. We take care of the @c const_cast for you.
