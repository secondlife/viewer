/**
 * LLProcess handles launching an external process with specified command line
 * arguments. It also keeps track of whether the process is still running, and
 * can kill it if required.
 *
 * In discussing LLProcess, we use the term "parent" to refer to this process
 * (the process invoking LLProcess), versus "child" to refer to the process
 * spawned by LLProcess.
 *
 * LLProcess relies on periodic post() calls on the "mainloop" LLEventPump: an
 * LLProcess object's Status won't update until the next "mainloop" tick. For
 * instance, the Second Life viewer's main loop already posts to an
 * LLEventPump by that name once per iteration. See
 * indra/llcommon/tests/llprocess_test.cpp for an example of waiting for
 * child-process termination in a standalone test context.

		/**
		 * type of file handle to pass to child process
		 *
		 * - "" (default): let the child inherit the same file handle used by
		 *   this process. For instance, if passed as stdout, child stdout
		 *   will be interleaved with stdout from this process. In this case,
		 *   @a name is moot and should be left "".
		 *
		 * - "file": open an OS filesystem file with the specified @a name.
		 *   <i>Not yet implemented.</i>
		 *
		 * - "pipe" or "tpipe" or "npipe": depends on @a name
		 *
		 *   - @a name.empty(): construct an OS pipe used only for this slot
		 *     of the forthcoming child process.
		 *
		 *   - ! @a name.empty(): in a global registry, find or create (using
		 *     the specified @a name) an OS pipe. The point of the (purely
		 *     internal) @a name is that passing the same @a name in more than
		 *     one slot for a given LLProcess -- or for slots in different
		 *     LLProcess instances -- means the same pipe. For example, you
		 *     might pass the same @a name value as both stdout and stderr to
		 *     make the child process produce both on the same actual pipe. Or
		 *     you might pass the same @a name as the stdout for one LLProcess
		 *     and the stdin for another to connect the two child processes.
		 *     Use LLProcess::getPipeName() to generate a unique name
		 *     guaranteed not to already exist in the registry. <i>Not yet
		 *     implemented.</i>
		 *
		 *   The difference between "pipe", "tpipe" and "npipe" is as follows.
		 *
		 *   - "pipe": direct LLProcess to monitor the parent end of the pipe,
		 *     pumping nonblocking I/O every frame. The expectation (at least
		 *     for stdout or stderr) is that the caller will listen for
		 *     incoming data and consume it as it arrives. It's important not
		 *     to neglect such a pipe, because it's buffered in memory. If you
		 *     suspect the child may produce a great volume of output between
		 *     frames, consider directing the child to write to a filesystem
		 *     file instead, then read the file later.
		 *
		 *   - "tpipe": do not engage LLProcess machinery to monitor the
		 *     parent end of the pipe. A "tpipe" is used only to connect
		 *     different child processes. As such, it makes little sense to
		 *     pass an empty @a name. <i>Not yet implemented.</i>
		 *
		 *   - "npipe": like "tpipe", but use an OS named pipe with a
		 *     generated name. Note that @a name is the @em internal name of
		 *     the pipe in our global registry -- it doesn't necessarily have
		 *     anything to do with the pipe's name in the OS filesystem. Use
		 *     LLProcess::getPipeName() to obtain the named pipe's OS
		 *     filesystem name, e.g. to pass it as the @a name to another
		 *     LLProcess instance using @a type "file". This supports usage
		 *     like bash's &lt;(subcommand...) or &gt;(subcommand...)
		 *     constructs. <i>Not yet implemented.</i>
		 *
		 * In all cases the open mode (read, write) is determined by the child
		 * slot you're filling. Child stdin means select the "read" end of a
		 * pipe, or open a filesystem file for reading; child stdout or stderr
		 * means select the "write" end of a pipe, or open a filesystem file
		 * for writing.
		 *
		 * Confusion such as passing the same pipe as the stdin of two
		 * processes (rather than stdout for one and stdin for the other) is
		 * explicitly permitted: it's up to the caller to construct meaningful
		 * LLProcess pipe graphs.
