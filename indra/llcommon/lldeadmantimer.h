/// @file lldeadmantimer.h
///
/// There are interesting user-experienced events in the viewer that
/// would seem to have well-defined start and stop points but which
/// actually lack such milestones in the code.  Such events (like
/// time to load meshes after logging in, initial inventory load,
/// display name fetch) can be defined somewhat after-the-fact by
/// noticing when we no longer perform operations towards their
/// completion.  This class is intended to help in such applications.
///
/// What it implements is a deadman's switch (also known as a
/// keepalive switch and a doorbell switch).  The basic operation is
/// as follows:
///
/// * LLDeadmanTimer is instantiated with a horizon value in seconds,
///   one for each event of interest.
/// * When an event starts, @see start() is invoked to begin a
///   timing operation.
/// * As operations are performed in service of the event (issuing
///   HTTP requests, receiving responses), @see ringBell() is invoked
///   to inform the timer that the operation is still active.
/// * If the operation is canceled or otherwise terminated, @see
///   stop() can be called to end the timing operation.
/// * Concurrent with the ringBell() calls, the program makes
///   periodic (shorter than the horizon but not too short) calls
///   to @see isExpired() to see if the event has expired due to
///   either a stop() call or lack of activity (defined as a ringBell()
///   call in the previous 'horizon' seconds).  If it has expired,
///   the caller also receives start, stop and count values for the
///   event which the application can then report in whatever manner
///   it sees fit.
/// * The timer becomes passive after an isExpired() call that returns
///   true.  It can then be restarted with a new start() call.
///
/// Threading:  Instances are not thread-safe.  They also use
/// timing code from lltimer.h which is also unsafe.
///
/// Allocation:  Not refcounted, may be stack or heap allocated.
///
