 * @brief  The Mac system headers seem to #define macros with obnoxiously
 *         generic names, preventing any library from using those names. We've
 *         had to fix these in so many places that it's worth making a header
 *         file to handle it.

// DON'T use an #include guard: every time we encounter this header, #undef
// these macros all over again.

// who injects MACROS with such generic names?! Grr.
