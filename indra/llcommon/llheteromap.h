/**
 * LLHeteroMap addresses an odd requirement. Usually when you want to put
 * objects of different classes into a runtime collection of any kind, you
 * derive them all from a common base class and store pointers to that common
 * base class.
 *
 * LLInitParam::BaseBlock uses disturbing raw-pointer arithmetic to find data
 * members in its subclasses. It seems that no BaseBlock subclass can be
 * stored in a polymorphic class of any kind: the presence of a vtbl pointer
 * in the layout silently throws off the reinterpret_cast arithmetic. Bad
 * Things result. (Many thanks to Nicky D for this analysis!)
 *
 * LLHeteroMap collects objects WITHOUT a common base class, retrieves them by
 * object type and destroys them when the LLHeteroMap is destroyed.
