/// HttpRequest supplies the entry into the HTTP transport
/// services in the LLCore libraries.  Services provided include:
///
/// - Some, but not all, global initialization of libcurl.
/// - Starting asynchronous, threaded HTTP requests.
/// - Definition of policy classes affect request handling.
/// - Utilities to control request options and headers
///
/// Requests
///
/// The class supports the current HTTP request operations:
///
/// - requestGetByteRange:  GET with Range header for a single range of bytes
/// - requestGet:
/// - requestPost:
/// - requestPut:
///
/// Policy Classes
///
/// <TBD>
///
/// Usage
///
/// <TBD>
///
/// Threading:  An instance may only be used by one application/
/// consumer thread.  But a thread may have as many instances of
/// this as it likes.
///
/// Allocation:  Not refcounted, may be stack allocated though that
/// hasn't been tested.  Queued requests can still run and any
/// queued replies will keep refcounts to the reply queue leading
/// to memory leaks.
///
/// @pre Before using this class (static or instances), some global
/// initialization is required.  See @see httpcommon.h for more information.
