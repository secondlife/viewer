/// @package LLCore::HTTP
///
/// This library implements a high-level, Indra-code-free (somewhat) client
/// interface to HTTP services based on actual patterns found in the viewer
/// and simulator.  Interfaces are similar to those supplied by the legacy classes
/// LLCurlRequest and LLHTTPClient.  To that is added a policy scheme that
/// allows an application to specify connection behaviors:  limits on
/// connections, HTTP keepalive, HTTP pipelining, retry-on-error limits, etc.
///
/// Features of the library include:
/// - Single, private working thread where all transport and processing occurs.
/// - Support for multiple consumers running in multiple threads.
/// - Scatter/gather (a.k.a. buffer array) model for bulk data movement.
/// - Reference counting used for many object instance lifetimes.
/// - Minimal data sharing across threads for correctness and low latency.
///
/// The public interface is declared in a few key header files:
/// - "llcorehttp/bufferarray.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpcommon.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httphandler.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpheaders.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpoptions.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httprequest.h"
/// - "llcorehttp/httpresponse.h"
///
/// The library is still under development and particular users
/// may need access to internal implementation details that are found
/// in the _*.h header files.  But this is a crutch to be avoided if at
/// all possible and probably indicates some interface work is neeeded.
///
/// Using the library is fairly easy.  Global setup needs a few
/// steps:
///
/// - libcurl initialization including thread-safely callbacks for SSL:
///   .  curl_global_init(...)
///   .  CRYPTO_set_locking_callback(...)
///   .  CRYPTO_set_id_callback(...)
/// - HttpRequest::createService() called to instantiate singletons
///   and support objects.
/// - HttpRequest::startThread() to kick off the worker thread and
///   begin servicing requests.
///
/// An HTTP consumer in an application, and an application may have many
/// consumers, does a few things:
///
/// - Instantiate and retain an object based on HttpRequest.  This
///   object becomes the portal into runtime services for the consumer.
/// - Derive or mixin the HttpHandler class if you want notification
///   when requests succeed or fail.  This object's onCompleted()
///   method is invoked and an instance can be shared across
///   requests.
///
/// Issuing a request is straightforward:
/// - Construct a suitable URL.
/// - Configure HTTP options for the request.  (optional)
/// - Build a list of additional headers.  (optional)
/// - Invoke one of the requestXXXX() methods (requestGetByteRange,
///   requestPost, etc.) on the HttpRequest instance supplying the
///   above along with a policy class, a priority and an optional
///   pointer to an HttpHandler instance.  Work is then queued to
///   the worker thread and occurs asynchronously.
/// - Periodically invoke the update() method on the HttpRequest
///   instance which performs completion notification to HttpHandler
///   objects.
/// - Do completion processing in your onCompletion() method.
///
/// Code fragments.
///
/// Initialization.  Rather than a poorly-maintained example in
/// comments, look in the example subdirectory which is a minimal
/// yet functional tool to do GET request performance testing.
/// With four calls:
///
///     init_curl();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest::createService();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest::startThread();
///     LLCore::HttpRequest * hr = new LLCore::HttpRequest();
///
/// the program is basically ready to issue requests.
///
/// HttpHandler.  Having started life as a non-indra library,
/// this code broke away from the classic Responder model and
/// introduced a handler class to represent an interface for
/// request responses.  This is a non-reference-counted entity
/// which can be used as a base class or a mixin.  An instance
/// of a handler can be used for each request or can be shared
/// among any number of requests.  Your choice but expect to
/// code something like the following:
///
///     class AppHandler : public LLCore::HttpHandler
///     {
///     public:
///         virtual void onCompleted(HttpHandle handle,
///                                  HttpResponse * response)
///         {
///             ...
///         }
///         ...
///     };
///     ...
///     handler = new handler(...);
///
///
/// Issuing requests.  Using 'hr' above,
///
///     hr->requestGet(HttpRequest::DEFAULT_POLICY_ID,
///                    0,               // Priority, not used yet
///                    url,
///                    NULL,            // options
///                    NULL,            // additional headers
///                    handler);
///
/// If that returns a value other than LLCORE_HTTP_HANDLE_INVALID,
/// the request was successfully issued and there will eventally
/// be a status delivered to the handler.  If invalid is returnedd,
/// the actual status can be retrieved by calling hr->getStatus().
///
/// Completing requests and delivering notifications.  Operations
/// are all performed by the worker thread and will be driven to
/// completion regardless of caller actions.  Notification of
/// completion (success or failure) is done by calls to
/// HttpRequest::update() which will invoke handlers for completed
/// requests:
///
///     hr->update(0);
///       // Callbacks into handler->onCompleted()
///
///
/// Threads.
///
/// Threads are supported and used by this library.  The various
/// classes, methods and members are documented with thread
/// constraints which programmers must follow and which are
/// defined as follows:
///
/// consumer    Any thread that has instanced HttpRequest and is
///             issuing requests.  A particular instance can only
///             be used by one consumer thread but a consumer may
///             have many instances available to it.
/// init        Special consumer thread, usually the main thread,
///             involved in setting up the library at startup.
/// worker      Thread used internally by the library to perform
///             HTTP operations.  Consumers will not have to deal
///             with this thread directly but some APIs are reserved
///             to it.
/// any         Consumer or worker thread.
///
/// For the most part, API users will not have to do much in the
/// way of ensuring thread safely.  However, there is a tremendous
/// amount of sharing between threads of read-only data.  So when
/// documentation declares that an option or header instance
/// becomes shared between consumer and worker, the consumer must
/// not modify the shared object.
///
/// Internally, there is almost no thread synchronization.  During
/// normal operations (non-init, non-term), only the request queue
/// and the multiple reply queues are shared between threads and
/// only here are mutexes used.
