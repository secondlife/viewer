// If you find this included in a public interface header,
// something wrong is probably happening.


// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// General library to-do list
//
// - Implement policy classes.  Structure is mostly there just didn't
//   need it for the first consumer.  [Classes are there.  More
//   advanced features, like borrowing, aren't there yet.]
// - Consider Removing 'priority' from the request interface.  Its use
//   in an always active class can lead to starvation of low-priority
//   requests.  Requires coodination of priority values across all
//   components that share a class.  Changing priority across threads
//   is slightly expensive (relative to gain) and hasn't been completely
//   implemented.  And the major user of priority, texture fetches,
//   may not really need it.
// - Set/get for global policy and policy classes is clumsy.  Rework
//   it heading in a direction that allows for more dynamic behavior.
//   [Mostly fixed]
// - Move HttpOpRequest::prepareRequest() to HttpLibcurl for the
//   pedantic.
// - Update downloader and other long-duration services are going to
//   need a progress notification.  Initial idea is to introduce a
//   'repeating request' which can piggyback on another request and
//   persist until canceled or carrier completes.  Current queue
//   structures allow an HttpOperation object to be enqueued
//   repeatedly, so...
// - Investigate making c-ares' re-implementation of a resolver library
//   more resilient or more intelligent on Mac.  Part of the DNS failure
//   lies in here.  The mechanism also looks a little less dynamic
//   than needed in an environments where networking is changing.
// - Global optimizations:  'borrowing' connections from other classes,
//   HTTP pipelining.
// - Dynamic/control system stuff:  detect problems and self-adjust.
//   This won't help in the face of the router problems we've looked
//   at, however.  Detect starvation due to UDP activity and provide
//   feedback to it.
// - Change the transfer timeout scheme.  We're less interested in
//   absolute time, in most cases, than in continuous progress.
// - Many of the policy class settings are currently applied to the
//   entire class.  Some, like connection limits, would be better
//   applied to each destination target making multiple targets
//   independent.
//
// Integration to-do list
// - LLTextureFetch still needs a major refactor.  The use of
//   LLQueuedThread makes it hard to inspect workers and do the
//   resource waiting we're now doing.  Rebuild along simpler lines
//   some of which are suggested in new commentary at the top of
//   the main source file.
// - Expand areas of usage eventually leading to the removal of LLCurl.
//   Rough order of expansion:
//   .  Avatar names
//   .  Group membership lists
//   .  Caps access in general
//   .  'The rest'
// - Adapt texture cache, image decode and other image consumers to
//   the BufferArray model to reduce data copying.  Alternatively,
//   adapt this library to something else.
//
// --------------------------------------------------------------------


// If '1', internal ready queues will not order ready
// requests by priority, instead it's first-come-first-served.
// Reprioritization requests have the side-effect of then
// putting the modified request at the back of the ready queue.
