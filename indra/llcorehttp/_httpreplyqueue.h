/// HttpService object, this queue is 1:1 with HttpRequest
/// instances and isn't explicitly referenced by the
/// service object.  Instead, HttpOperation objects that
/// want to generate replies back to their creators also
/// keep references to the corresponding HttpReplyQueue.
/// The HttpService plumbing then simply delivers replies
/// to the requested reply queue.
///
/// One result of that is that the fetch operations do
/// not have a wait forever option.  The service object
/// doesn't keep handles on everything it would need to
/// notify so it can't wake up sleepers should it need to
/// shutdown.  So only non-blocking or timed-blocking modes
/// are anticipated.  These are how most application consumers
/// will be coded anyway so it shouldn't be too much of a
/// burden.
