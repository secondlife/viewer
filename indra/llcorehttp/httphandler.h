/// HttpHandler defines an interface used by the library to
/// notify library callers of significant events, currently
/// request completion.  Callers must derive or mixin this class
/// then provide an implementation of the @see onCompleted
/// method to receive such notifications.  An instance may
/// be shared by any number of requests and across instances
/// of HttpRequest running in the same thread.
///
/// Threading:  HttpHandler itself is interface and is
/// tread-compatible.  Most derivations, however, will have
/// different constraints.
///
/// Allocation:  Not refcounted, may be stack allocated though
/// that is rarely a good idea.  Queued requests and replies keep
/// a naked pointer to the handler and this can result in a
/// dangling pointer if lifetimes aren't managed correctly.

	///							The response object is refcounted and
	///							the called code may retain the object
	///							by invoking @see addRef() on it.  The
	///							library itself drops all references to
	///							to object on return and never touches
	///							it again.
