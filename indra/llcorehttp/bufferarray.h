/// A very simple scatter/gather type map for bulk data.  The motivation
/// for this class is the writedata callback used by libcurl.  Response
/// bodies are delivered to the caller in a sequence of sequential write
/// operations and this class captures them without having to reallocate
/// and move data.
///
/// The interface looks a little like a unix file descriptor but only
/// just.  There is a notion of a current position, starting from 0,
/// which is used as the position in the data when performing read and
/// write operations.  The position also moves after various operations:
/// - seek(...)
/// - read(...)
/// - write(...)
/// - append(...)
/// - appendBufferAlloc(...)
/// The object also keeps a total length value which is updated after
/// write and append operations and beyond which the current position
/// cannot be set.
///
/// Threading:  not thread-safe
///
/// Allocation:  Refcounted, heap only.  Caller of the constructor
/// is given a single refcount.
