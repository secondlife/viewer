///
/// Maintains an ordered list of name/value pairs representing
/// HTTP header lines.  This is used both to provide additional
/// headers when making HTTP requests and in responses when the
/// caller has asked that headers be returned (not the default
/// option).
///
/// Class is mostly a thin wrapper around a vector of pairs
/// of strings.  Methods provided are few and intended to
/// reflect actual use patterns.  These include:
/// - Clearing the list
/// - Appending a name/value pair to the vector
/// - Processing a raw byte string into a normalized name/value
///   pair and appending the result.
/// - Simple case-sensitive find-last-by-name search
/// - Forward and reverse iterators over all pairs
///
/// Container is ordered and multi-valued.  Headers are
/// written in the order in which they are appended and
/// are stored in the order in which they're received from
/// the wire.  The same header may appear two or more times
/// in any container.  Searches using the simple find()
/// interface will find only the last occurrence (somewhat
/// simulates the use of std::map).  Fuller searches require
/// the use of an iterator.  Headers received from the wire
/// are only returned from the last request when redirections
/// are involved.
///
/// Threading:  Not intrinsically thread-safe.  It *is* expected
/// that callers will build these objects and then share them
/// via reference counting with the worker thread.  The implication
/// is that once an HttpHeader instance is handed to a request,
/// the object must be treated as read-only.
///
/// Allocation:  Refcounted, heap only.  Caller of the
/// constructor is given a refcount.
