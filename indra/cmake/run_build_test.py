@brief  Helper script to allow CMake to run some command after setting
        environment variables.

CMake has commands to run an external program. But remember that each CMake
command must be backed by multiple build-system implementations. Unfortunately
it seems CMake can't promise that every target build system can set specified
environment variables before running the external program of interest.

This helper script is a workaround. It simply sets the requested environment
variables and then executes the program specified on the rest of its command
line.

Example:

python3 run_build_test.py -DFOO=bar myprog somearg otherarg

sets environment variable FOO=bar, then runs:
myprog somearg otherarg
