The Abuse Team investigates and issues appropriate disciplinary action for behavior that violates the [SECOND_LIFE] [http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php Terms of Service] or [http://secondlife.com/corporate/cs.php Community Standards]. However, the Abuse Team does not handle and will not respond to requests to remove content from the [SECOND_LIFE] world.

(2) The DMCA or Content Removal Process. To request removal of content from [SECOND_LIFE], you MUST submit a valid notification of infringement as provided in our [http://secondlife.com/corporate/dmca.php DMCA Policy].

If you still wish to continue with the abuse process, please close this window and finish submitting your report.  You may need to select the specific category &apos;CopyBot or Permissions Exploit&apos;.

Thank you,
