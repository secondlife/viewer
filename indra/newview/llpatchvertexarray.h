// A LLPatchVertexArray is really just a structure of vertex arrays for
// rendering a "patch" of a certain size.
//
// A "patch" is currently a sub-square of a larger square array of data
// we call a "surface".

    U32 *mRenderLevelp; // Look-up table  : render_stride -> render_level
    U32 *mRenderStridep; // Look-up table : render_level -> render_stride

    // We want to be able to render a patch from multiple resolutions.
    // The lowest resolution has two triangles, and the highest has
    // 2*mPatchWidth*mPatchWidth triangles.
    //
    // mPatchWidth is not hard-coded, so we don't know how much memory
    // to allocate to the vertex arrays until it is set.  Once it is
    // set, we will calculate how much total memory to allocate for the
    // vertex arrays, and then keep track of their lengths and locations
    // in the memory bank.
    //
    // A Patch has three regions that need vertex arrays: middle, north,
    // and east.  For each region there are three items that must be
    // kept track of: data, offset, and length.
