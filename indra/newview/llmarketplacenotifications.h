// This is a set of helper functions to handle a unique notification with multiple
// payloads, helpful when dragging and dropping items to the merchant outbox that
// trigger notifications that can potentially interfere with the current drag and
// drop operation.
//
// Notification payloads are cached locally when initiated, the notification itself
// is triggered on the following frame during the call to "update" and then the
// response is triggered once per payload.
