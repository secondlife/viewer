## Here are some configuration options for Linux Client Testers.
## These options are for self-assisted troubleshooting during this beta
## testing phase; you should not usually need to touch them.

## - Avoids using any OpenAL audio driver.
#export LL_BAD_OPENAL_DRIVER=x

## - Avoids the optional OpenGL extensions which have proven most problematic
##   on some hardware.  Disabling this option may cause BETTER PERFORMANCE but
##   may also cause CRASHES and hangs on some unstable combinations of drivers
##   and hardware.
## NOTE: This is now disabled by default.
#export LL_GL_BASICEXT=x

## - Avoids *all* optional OpenGL extensions.  This is the safest and least-
##   exciting option.  Enable this if you experience stability issues, and
##   report whether it helps in the Linux Client Testers forum.
#export LL_GL_NOEXT=x

## - For advanced troubleshooters, this lets you disable specific GL
##   extensions, each of which is represented by a letter a-o.  If you can
##   narrow down a stability problem on your system to just one or two
##   extensions then please post details of your hardware (and drivers) to
##   the Linux Client Testers forum along with the minimal
##   LL_GL_BLACKLIST which solves your problems.
#export LL_GL_BLACKLIST=abcdefghijklmno

if [ "`uname -m`" = "x86_64" ]; then
    echo '64-bit Linux detected.'
fi

## Everything below this line is just for advanced troubleshooters.
##-------------------------------------------------------------------

## - For advanced debugging cases, you can run the viewer under the
##   control of another program, such as strace, gdb, or valgrind.  If
##   you're building your own viewer, bear in mind that the executable
##   in the bin directory will be stripped: you should replace it with
##   an unstripped binary before you run.
#export LL_WRAPPER='gdb --args'
#export LL_WRAPPER='valgrind --smc-check=all --error-limit=no --log-file=secondlife.vg --leak-check=full --suppressions=/usr/lib/valgrind/glibc-2.5.supp --suppressions=secondlife-i686.supp'

## - The 'scim' GTK IM module widely crashes the viewer.  Avoid it.
if [ "$GTK_IM_MODULE" = "scim" ]; then
    export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim
fi
if [ "$XMODIFIERS" = "" ]; then
    ## IME is valid only for fcitx, not when using ibus
    export XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx"
fi
