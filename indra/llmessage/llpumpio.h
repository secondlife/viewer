/**
 * @class LLPumpIO
 * @brief Class to manage sets of io chains.
 *
 * The pump class provides a thread abstraction for doing IO based
 * communication between two threads in a structured and optimized for
 * processor time. The primary usage is to create a pump, and call
 * <code>pump()</code> on a thread used for IO and call
 * <code>respond()</code> on a thread that is expected to do higher
 * level processing. You can call almost any other method from any
 * thread - see notes for each method for details. In order for the
 * threading abstraction to work, you need to call <code>prime()</code>
 * with a valid apr pool.
 * A pump instance manages much of the state for the pipe, including
 * the list of pipes in the chain, the channel for each element in the
 * chain, the buffer, and if any pipe has marked the stream or process
 * as done. Pipes can also set file descriptor based conditional
 * statements so that calls to process do not happen until data is
 * ready to be read or written.  Pipes control execution of calls to
 * process by returning a status code such as STATUS_OK or
 * STATUS_BREAK.
 * One way to conceptualize the way IO will work is that a pump
 * combines the unit processing of pipes to behave like file pipes on
 * the unix command line.
